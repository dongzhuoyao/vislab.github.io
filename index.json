Instead, we present an interesting finding that questions the necessity of the inductive bias of locality in modern computer vision architectures. Concretely, we find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results. This is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer, which maintains the inductive bias from ConvNets towards local neighborhoods (e.g. by treating each 16x16 patch as a token). We showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied computer vision tasks: supervised learning for classification and regression, self-supervised learning via masked autoencoding, and image generation with diffusion models. Although it's computationally less practical to directly operate on individual pixels, we believe the community must be made aware of this surprising piece of knowledge when devising the next generation of neural network architectures for computer vision.","tags":["Vision application"],"title":"An Image is Worth More Than 16x16 Patches: Exploring Transformers on Individual Pixels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diego Garcia Cerdas","Christina Sartzetaki","Magnus Petersen","Gemma Roig","Pascal Mettes","Iris I.A.

Advancements in generative modeling have enabled data-driven discovery of neural selectivity using brain-optimized image synthesis. However, current methods independently generate one sample at a time, without enforcing structural constraints on the generations; thus, these individual images have no explicit point of comparison, making it hard to discern which image features drive neural response selectivity. To address this issue, we introduce Brain Activation Control Through Image Variation (BrainACTIV), a method for manipulating a reference image to enhance or decrease activity in a target cortical region using pretrained diffusion models. Starting from a reference image allows for fine-grained and reliable offline identification of optimal visuo-semantic properties, as well as producing controlled stimuli for novel neuroimaging studies. We show that our manipulations effectively modulate predicted fMRI responses and agree with hypothesized preferred categories in established regions of interest, while remaining structurally close to the reference image. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method accentuates differences between brain regions that are selective to the same category, and how it could be used to explore neural representation of brain regions with unknown selectivities. Hence, BrainACTIV holds the potential to formulate robust hypotheses about brain representation and to facilitate the production of naturalistic stimuli for neuroscientific experiments.","tags":["Generative model","Neuroscience","Image manipulation"],"title":"BrainACTIV: Identifying visuo-semantic properties driving cortical selectivity using diffusion-based image manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Liu","Pan Zhou","Yinjun Du","Ah-Hwee Tan","Cees G.M.

Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation effi- ciency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and co- herent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress- based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Trans- port and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate CaPo’s much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.

Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.

Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa’s imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

Online test-time prompt tuning provides a simple way to leverage the information in previous test samples, albeit with the risk of prompt collapse due to error accumulation. To enhance test-time prompt tuning, we propose DynaPrompt, short for dynamic test-time prompt tuning, exploiting relevant data distribution information while reducing error accumulation. Built on an online prompt buffer, DynaPrompt adaptively selects and optimizes the relevant prompts for each test sample during tuning. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic prompt selection strategy based on two metrics: prediction entropy and probability difference. For unseen test data information, we develop dynamic prompt appending, which allows the buffer to append new prompts and delete the inactive ones. By doing so, the prompts are optimized to exploit beneficial information on specific test data, while alleviating error accumulation. Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic test-time prompt tuning.","tags":["Transfer","low-shot","semi- and un-supervised learning"],"title":"DynaPrompt: Dynamic Test-Time Prompt Tuning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Gkountouras","Matthias Lindemann","Phillip Lippe","Efstratios Gavves","Ivan Titov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1743465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743465600,"objectID":"e92b0d9241c9e5f8256f0d68490ff674","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/phillip-iclr-2025/","publishdate":"2025-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/phillip-iclr-2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great promise in planning and reasoning applications. These tasks demand robust systems, which arguably require a causal understanding of the environment. While LLMs can acquire and reflect common sense causal knowledge from their pretraining data, this information is often incomplete, incorrect, or inapplicable to a specific environment. In contrast, causal representation learning (CRL) focuses on identifying the underlying causal structure within a given environment. We propose a framework that integrates CRLs with LLMs to enable causally-aware reasoning and planning. This framework learns a causal world model, with causal variables linked to natural language expressions. This mapping provides LLMs with a flexible interface to process and generate descriptions of actions and states in text form. Effectively, the causal world model acts as a simulator that the LLM can query and interact with. We evaluate the framework on causal inference and planning tasks across temporal scales and environmental complexities. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with the causally-aware method outperforming LLM-based reasoners, especially for longer planning horizons.","tags":["Generative model"],"title":"Language Agents Meet Causality -- Bridging LLMs and Causal World Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentinos Pariza","Mohammadreza Salehi","Gertjan J.

Compared to contrastive approaches that only yield binary learning signals, i.e. \"attract\" and \"repel\", this approach benefits from the more fine-grained learning signal of sorting spatially dense features relative to reference patches.

Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging (fMRI) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of CNNs and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain.","tags":["Video understanding","Neuroscience","Representational alignment"],"title":"One Hundred Neural Networks and Brains Watching Videos: Lessons from Alignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivona Najdenkoska*","Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani*","Yuki M.

Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images.

We observe that both steps are sub-optimal: the first involves regressing proposals to the entire ground truth, which is a difficult task even with large receptive fields, and the second neglects valuable information from boxes other than the top candidate. Instead of regressing proposals to the whole ground truth, we propose a simpler approach: regress only to the area of intersection between the proposal and the ground truth. This avoids the need for proposals to extrapolate beyond their visual scope, improving localization accuracy. Rather than adopting a winner-takes-all strategy, we take the union over the regressed intersections of all boxes in a region to generate the final box outputs. Our plug-and-play method integrates seamlessly into proposal-based, grid-based, and query-based detection architectures with minimal modifications, consistently improving object localization and instance segmentation.

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for the creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.","tags":["Transfer, low-shot, semi- and un-supervised learning"],"title":"IPO: Interpretable Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Walter Simoncini","Spyros Gidaris","Andrei Bursuc","Yuki M.

We construct such a dataset from a single fractal with perturbations. With this, we contribute three main findings. (i) We show that pre-training is effective even with minimal synthetic images, with performance on par with large-scale pre-training datasets like ImageNet-1k for full fine-tuning. (ii) We investigate the single parameter with which we construct artificial categories for our dataset. We find that while the shape differences can be indistinguishable to humans, they are crucial for obtaining strong performances. (iii) Finally, we investigate the minimal requirements for successful pre-training. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial reduction of synthetic images from 1k to 1 can even lead to an increase in pre-training performance, a motivation to further investigate ''scaling backwards''. Finally, we extend our method from synthetic images to real images to see if a single real image can show similar pre-training effect through shape augmentation. We find that the use of grayscale images and affine transformations allows even real images to ''scale backwards.","tags":["Self-supervised learning"],"title":" Scaling Backwards: Minimal Synthetic Pretraining?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luc P.J.

In this paper, we present GeneralAD, an anomaly detection framework designed to operate in semantic, near-distribution, and industrial settings with minimal per-task adjustments. In our approach, we capitalize on the inherent design of Vision Transformers, which are trained on image patches, thereby ensuring that the last hidden states retain a patch-based structure.

In this paper, we conduct an analysis of such inefficiencies, and suggest simple yet effective modifications that allow significant speed-ups whilst maintaining quality. Moreover, we introduce Object-Centric Diffusion, to fix generation artifacts and further reduce latency by allocating more computations towards foreground edited regions, arguably more important for perceptual quality. We achieve this by two novel proposals: i) Object-Centric Sampling, decoupling the diffusion steps spent on salient or background regions and spending most on the former, and ii) Object-Centric Token Merging, which reduces cost of cross-frame attention by fusing redundant tokens in unimportant background regions. Both techniques are readily applicable to a given video editing model without retraining, and can drastically reduce its memory and computational cost.

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode.

To understand brain function at the laminar level, it is crucial to distinguish neuronal signal contributions from those determined by the cortical vascular organization. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the purely vascular contribution in the BOLD signal by using vasoactive stimuli and compare that with neuronal-induced BOLD responses from a visual task. To do so, we estimated the hemodynamic response function (HRF) across cortical depth following brief visual stimulations under different conditions using ultrahigh-field (7 Tesla) functional (f)MRI. We acquired gradient-echo (GE)-echo-planar-imaging (EPI) BOLD, containing contributions from all vessel sizes, and spin-echo (SE)-EPI BOLD for which signal changes predominately originate from microvessels, to distinguish signal weighting from different vascular compartments. Non-neuronal hemodynamic changes were induced by hypercapnia and hyperoxia to estimate cerebrovascular reactivity and venous cerebral blood volume (WJ). Results show that increases in GE HRF amplitude from deeper to superficial layers coincided with increased macrovascular WJ. -normalized GE-HRF amplitudes yielded similar cortical depth profiles as SE, thereby possibly improving specificity to neuronal activation. For GE BOLD, faster onset time and shorter time-to-peak were observed toward the deeper layers. Hypercapnia reduced the amplitude of visual stimulus-induced signal responses as denoted by lower GE-HRF amplitudes and longer time-to-peak. In contrast, the SE-HRF amplitude was unaffected by hypercapnia, suggesting that these responses reflect predominantly neurovascular processes that are less contaminated by macrovascular signal contributions.","tags":["MRI, brain activity measurements"],"title":"The contribution of the vascular architecture and cerebrovascular reactivity to the BOLD signal formation across cortical depth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lars Doorenbos","Pablo Márquez Neila","Raphael Sznitman","Pascal Mettes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717632000,"objectID":"d1ff03a9d7637bcf5a379964131650de","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/pascal-tmlr-2024/","publishdate":"2024-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/pascal-tmlr-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Hyperbolic space is becoming a popular choice for representing data due to the hierarchical structure - whether implicit or explicit - of many real-world datasets.

We, therefore, propose to generalize the well-known random forests to hyperbolic space. We do this by redefining the notion of a split using horospheres. Since finding the globally optimal split is computationally intractable, we find candidate horospheres through a large-margin classifier. To make hyperbolic random forests work on multi-class data and imbalanced experiments, we furthermore outline new methods for combining classes based on the lowest common ancestor and class-balanced large-margin losses.

We explicitly connect training and test distributions in the latent space by constructing training and test prompts in a hierarchical architecture. Within this framework, the test prompt exploits the distribution relationships to guide the generalization of the CLIP image-language model from training to any test distribution. To effectively encode the distribution information and their relationships, we further introduce a transformer inference network with a pseudo-shift training mechanism.

Subsequently, a number of works have explored the use of NeFs as representations for downstream tasks, e.g. classifying an image based on the parameters of a NeF that has been fit to it. However, the impact of the NeF hyperparameters on their quality as downstream representation is scarcely understood and remains largely unexplored. This is in part caused by the large amount of time required to fit datasets of neural fields. In this work, we propose a JAX-based library that leverages parallelization to enable fast optimization of large-scale NeF datasets, resulting in a significant speed-up. With this library, we perform a comprehensive study that investigates the effects of different hyperparameters on fitting NeFs for downstream tasks. In particular, we explore the use of a shared initialization, the effects of overtraining, and the expressiveness of the network architectures used. Our study provides valuable insights on how to train NeFs and offers guidance for optimizing their effectiveness in downstream applications.

In adults, seeing the original photo triggers perceptual reorganization, causing mandatory recognition of the two-tone version. This involves top-down signaling from higher-order brain areas to early visual cortex. We show that children younger than 7–9 years do not experience this knowledge-guided shift, despite viewing the original photo immediately before each two-tone. To assess computations underlying this development, we compared human performance to three neural networks with varying architectures. The best-performing model behaved much like 4- to 5-year-olds, displaying feature-based rather than holistic processing strategies.

The first is a counting-specific augmentation that leverages point annotations to simulate occluded objects in both input and density images to enhance the network's robustness to occlusions. The second method, foreground distillation, generates foreground masks from the point annotations, from which we train an auxiliary network on images with blacked-out backgrounds. By doing so, it learns to extract foreground counting knowledge without interference from the background. These methods can be seamlessly integrated with existing counting advances and are adaptable to different loss functions.

Initially, it was thought that scenes are constructed and represented by their component objects. An alternative view proposed that scene perception starts by extracting global features (e.g., spatial layout) first and individual objects in later stages. A third framework focuses on how the brain not only represents objects and layout but how this information combines to allow determining possibilities for (inter)action that the environment offers us. The discovery of scene-selective regions in the human visual system sparked interest in how scenes are represented in the brain. Experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging show that multiple types of information are encoded in the scene-selective regions, while electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography measurements demonstrate links between the rapid extraction of different scene features and scene perception behavior. Computational models such as deep neural networks offer further insight by how training networks on different scene recognition tasks results in the computation of diagnostic features that can then be tested for their ability to predict activity in human brains when perceiving a scene. Collectively, these findings suggest that the brain flexibly and rapidly extracts a variety of information from scenes using a distributed network of brain regions.","tags":["Human visual perception"],"title":"Visual Perception in the Human Brain: How the Brain Perceives and Understands Real-World Scenes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Mensink","Pascal Mettes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1700438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1700438400,"objectID":"4576d20824fec146a9ea2a0b72dd0cb2","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/pascal-bmvc-2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/pascal-bmvc-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Mixup is a widely adopted strategy for training deep networks, where additional samples are augmented by interpolating inputs and labels of training pairs. Mixup has shown to improve classification performance, network calibration, and out-of-distribution generalisation. While effective, a cornerstone of Mixup, namely that networks learn linear behaviour patterns between classes, is only indirectly enforced since the output interpolation is performed at the probability level. This paper seeks to address this limitation by mixing the classifiers directly instead of mixing the labels for each mixed pair. We propose to define the target of each augmented sample as a uniquely new classifier, whose parameters are a linear interpolation of the classifier vectors of the input pair. The space of all possible classifiers is continuous and spans all interpolations between classifier pairs. To make optimisation tractable, we propose a dual-contrastive Infinite Class Mixup loss, where we contrast the classifier of a mixed pair to both the classifiers and the predicted outputs of other mixed pairs in a batch. Infinite Class Mixup is generic in nature and applies to many variants of Mixup. Empirically, we show that it outperforms standard Mixup and variants such as RegMixup and Remix on balanced, long-tailed, and data-constrained benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.

In this work, we focus on discovering these fields, and infer them from the observed dynamics alone, without directly observing them. We theorize the presence of latent force fields, and propose neural fields to learn them. Since the observed dynamics constitute the net effect of local object interactions and global field effects, recently popularized equivariant networks are inapplicable, as they fail to capture global information. To address this, we propose to disentangle local object interactions –which are SE(3) equivariant and depend on relative states– from external global field effects –which depend on absolute states. We model the interactions with equivariant graph networks, and combine them with neural fields in a novel graph network that integrates field forces. Our experiments show that we can accurately discover the underlying fields in charged particles settings, traffic scenes, and gravitational n-body problems, and effectively use them to learn the system and forecast future trajectories.","tags":["Interacting dynamical systems"],"title":"Latent Field Discovery in Interacting Dynamical Systems with Neural Fields","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Rastegar","Hazel Doughty","Cees G M Snoek"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1698796800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698796800,"objectID":"817feafa470ccb41c79c9ecabd7301d7","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/sarah-neurips-2023/","publishdate":"2023-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/sarah-neurips-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"In the quest for unveiling novel categories at test time, we confront the inherent limitations of traditional supervised recognition models that are restricted by a predefined category set.

In this paper, we conceptualize a category through the lens of optimization, viewing it as an optimal solution to a well-defined problem. Harnessing this unique conceptualization, we propose a novel, efficient and self-supervised method capable of discovering previously unknown categories at test time. A salient feature of our approach is the assignment of minimum length category codes to individual data instances, which encapsulates the implicit category hierarchy prevalent in real-world datasets.

Experimental evaluations, bolstered by state-of-the-art benchmark comparisons, testify to the efficacy of our solution in managing unknown categories at test time.

Consistency regularization enforces the model to output the same representation or prediction for two views of one image. These constraints, however, are either too strict or not order-preserving for the classification probabilities.

The order-preserving property for the prediction makes the model robust to task-irrelevant transformations. As a result, the model becomes less sensitive to the domain-specific attributes.

Hyperbolic learning has recently shown great potential for visual understanding, but is currently only performed in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks. All visual representations are still learned through standard Euclidean networks. In this paper we investigate how to learn hyperbolic representations of visual data directly from the pixel-level. We propose Poincaré ResNet, a hyperbolic counterpart of the celebrated residual network, starting from Poincaré 2D convolutions up to Poincaré residual connections. We identify three roadblocks for training convolutional networks entirely in hyperbolic space and propose a solution for each: (i) Current hyperbolic network initializations collapse to the origin, limiting their applicability in deeper networks. We provide an identity-based initialization that preserves norms over many layers. (ii) Residual networks rely heavily on batch normalization, which comes with expensive Fréchet mean calculations in hyperbolic space. We introduce Poincaré midpoint batch normalization as a faster and equally effective alternative. (iii) Due to the many intermediate operations in Poincaré layers, the computation graphs of deep learning libraries blow up, limiting our ability to train on deep hyperbolic networks. We provide manual backward derivations of core hyperbolic operations to maintain manageable computation graphs.","tags":["Visual reasoning and logical representation"],"title":"Poincaré ResNet","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pengwan Yang","Cees G.

We separated the alpha oscillatory power from broadband power changes. The variation in alpha oscillatory power with stimulus position was then fit by a population receptive field (pRF) model. We find that the alpha pRFs have similar center locations to pRFs estimated from broadband power (70–180 Hz), but are several times larger.

The current state-of-the-art enables such a zero-shot recognition by learning universal mappings from videos to a semantic space, either trained on large-scale seen actions or on objects. While effective, we find that universal action and object mappings are biased to specific regions in the semantic space. These biases lead to a fundamental problem: many unseen action categories are simply never inferred during testing. For example on UCF-101, a quarter of the unseen actions are out of reach with a state-of-the-art universal action model. To that end, this paper introduces universal prototype transport for zero-shot action recognition. The main idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of unseen actions by matching them to the distribution of all test videos. For universal action models, we propose to match distributions through a hyperspherical optimal transport from unseen action prototypes to the set of all projected test videos. The resulting transport couplings in turn determine the target prototype for each unseen action. Rather than directly using the target prototype as final result, we re-position unseen action prototypes along the geodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes as a form of semantic regularization. For universal object models, we outline a variant that defines target prototypes based on an optimal transport between unseen action prototypes and object prototypes. Empirically, we show that universal prototype transport diminishes the biased selection of unseen action prototypes and boosts both universal action and object models for zero-shot classification and spatio-temporal localization.","tags":["Action and behavior recognition"],"title":"Universal Prototype Transport for Zero-Shot Action Recognition and Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuo Chen","Yingjun Du","Pascal Mettes","Cees G.

Recognizing the predicate between subject and object pairs is imbalanced and multi-label in nature, ranging from ubiquitous interactions such as spatial relationships (e.g. in front of ) to rare interactions such as twisting. In widely-used benchmarks such as Action Genome and VidOR, the imbalance ratio between the most and least frequent predicates reaches 3,218 and 3,408, respectively, surpassing even benchmarks specifically designed for long-tailed recognition. Due to the long-tailed distributions and label co-occurrences, recent state-of-the-art methods predominantly focus on the most frequently occurring predicate classes, ignoring those in the long tail. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of current approaches for scene graph generation in videos and identify a one-to-one correspondence between predicate frequency and recall performance. To make the step towards unbiased scene graph generation in videos, we introduce a multi-label meta-learning framework to deal with the biased predicate distribution. Our meta-learning framework learns a meta-weight network for each training sample over all possible label losses. We evaluate our approach on the Action Genome and VidOR benchmarks by building upon two current state-of-theart methods for each benchmark. The experiments demonstrate that the multi-label meta-weight network improves the performance for predicates in the long tail without compromising performance for head classes, resulting in better overall performance and favorable generalizability.","tags":["Recognition (object detection, categorization)"],"title":"Multi-Label Meta Weighting for Long-Tailed Dynamic Scene Graph Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yingjun Du","Jiayi Shen","Xiantong Zhen","Cees G.M.

While effective, these methods focus on independent objects, where the modes of one object are independent of the modes of the other objects.

Deep neural networks such as VoxelMorph and TransMorph are fast, but limited to small deformations and face challenges in the presence of large deformations. To tackle large deformations in medical image registration, we propose PC-Reg, a pyramidal Prediction and Correction method for deformable registration, which treats multi-scale registration akin to solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) across scales. Starting with a zero-initialized deformation at the coarse level, PC-Reg follows the predictor-corrector regime and progressively predicts a residual flow and a correction flow to update the deformation vector field through different scales. The prediction in each scale can be regarded as a single step of ODE integration. PC-Reg can be easily extended to diffeomorphic registration and is able to alleviate the multiscale accumulated upsampling and diffeomorphic integration error. Further, to transfer details from full resolution to low scale, we introduce a distillation loss, where the output is used as the target label for intermediate outputs. Experiments on inter-patient deformable registration show that the proposed method significantly improves registration not only for large but also for small deformations.","tags":["Medical Image Analysis"],"title":"PC-Reg: A pyramidal prediction–correction approach for large deformation image registration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas de Vries","Bart J Emmer","Charles BLM Majoie","Henk A Marquering","Efstratios Gavves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675296000,"objectID":"4c9bfa6de94909104459a18cfebdd1ce","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/statios-mia-2023/","publishdate":"2023-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/statios-mia-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"CT perfusion imaging is commonly used for infarct core quantification in acute ischemic stroke patients.

CT perfusion analysis software produces cerebral perfusion maps from commonly noisy spatio-temporal CT perfusion data. High levels of noise can influence the results of CT perfusion analysis, necessitating software tuning. This work proposes a novel approach for CT perfusion analysis that uses physics-informed learning, an optimization framework that is robust to noise. In particular, we propose SPPINN: Spatio-temporal Perfusion Physics-Informed Neural Network and research spatio-temporal physics-informed learning. SPPINN learns implicit neural representations of contrast attenuation in CT perfusion scans using the spatio-temporal coordinates of the data and employs these representations to estimate a continuous representation of the cerebral perfusion parameters. We validate the approach on simulated data to quantify perfusion parameter estimation performance. Furthermore, we apply the method to in-house patient data and the public Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation 2018 benchmark data to assess the correspondence between the perfusion maps and reference standard infarct core segmentations. Our method achieves accurate perfusion parameter estimates even with high noise levels and differentiates healthy tissue from infarcted tissue. Moreover, SPPINN perfusion maps accurately correspond with reference standard infarct core segmentations. Hence, we show that using spatio-temporal physics-informed learning for cerebral perfusion estimation is accurate, even in noisy CT perfusion data.

This effectively creates ``instantaneous' effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that allows for instantaneous effects in intervened temporal sequences when intervention targets can be observed, e.g., as actions of an agent. iCITRIS identifies the potentially multidimensional causal variables from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph.

Detecting OOD samples is challenging due to the intractability of modeling all possible unknown distributions. To date, several research domains tackle the problem of detecting unfamiliar samples, including anomaly detection, novelty detection, one-class learning, open set recognition, and out-of-distribution detection.

In contrast to this, we propose a comparatively simple approach - the Complex AutoEncoder (CAE) - that creates distributed object-centric representations. Following a coding scheme theorized to underlie object representations in biological neurons, its complex-valued activations represent two messages: their magnitudes express the presence of a feature, while the relative phase differences between neurons express which features should be bound together to create joint object representations. In contrast to previous approaches using complex-valued activations for object discovery, we present a fully unsupervised approach that is trained end-to-end - resulting in significant improvements in performance and efficiency.

To determine these parameters, limited sampling strategies (LSSs) may be applied. The study aims to establish adequate LSSs for estimating individual PK parameters of EHL-FIX concentrates using in silico evaluation. Methods Monte Carlo simulations were performed to obtain FIX activity versus time profiles using published population PK models for N9-GP (Refixia), rFIXFc (Alprolix), and rIX-FP (Idelvion). Fourteen LSSs, containing three or four samples taken within 8 days after administration, were formulated. Bayesian analysis was applied to obtain estimates for clearance (CL), half-life (t1/2), time to 1% (Time1%), and calculated weekly dose (Dose1%). Bias and precision of these estimates were assessed to determine which LSS was adequate. Results For all PK parameters of N9-GP, rFIXFc and rIX-FP bias was generally acceptable (range: −5% to 5%). For N9-GP, precision of all parameters for all LSSs was acceptable (","tags":["Pharmacology"],"title":"In silico evaluation of limited sampling strategies for individualized dosing of extended half-life factor IX concentrates in hemophilia B patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yoni Schirris","Mendel Engelaer","Andreas Panteli","Hugo Mark Horlings","Efstratios Gavves","Jonas Teuwen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673136000,"objectID":"b3f75f3be87f07c96341776d4e1901bc","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/y.schirris-mi-2022-/","publishdate":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/y.schirris-mi-2022-/","section":"publication","summary":"We present WeakSTIL, an interpretable two-stage weak label deep learning pipeline for scoring the percentage of stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (sTIL%) in H\u0026E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of breast cancer tissue. The sTIL% score is a prognostic and predictive biomarker for many solid tumor types. However, due to the high labeling efforts and high intra- and interobserver variability within and between expert annotators, this biomarker is currently not used in routine clinical decision making. WeakSTIL compresses tiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised learning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL% scores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning regressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak label, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently existing TIL detection methods. We show that WeakSTIL is at least as good as other TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching a coefficient of determination of 0.45 ± 0.15 when compared to scores generated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of 0.89 ± 0.05 when treating it as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task. Additionally, we show that the intermediate tile-level predictions of WeakSTIL are highly interpretable, which suggests that WeakSTIL pays attention to latent features related to the number of TILs and the tissue type. In the future, WeakSTIL may be used to provide consistent and interpretable sTIL% predictions to stratify breast cancer patients into targeted therapy arms.","tags":["AI for Health"],"title":"WeakSTIL: weak whole-slide image level stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocyte scores are all you need","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petr Byvshev","Pascal Mettes","Yu Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667260800,"objectID":"08d0584c14ce0d87546299eebbad50c7","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/pascal-cviu-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/pascal-cviu-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"3D convolutional networks, as direct inheritors of 2D convolutional networks for images, have placed their mark on action recognition in videos. Combined with pretraining on large-scale video data, high classification accuracies have been obtained on numerous video benchmarks. In an effort to better understand why 3D convolutional networks are so effective, several works have highlighted their bias towards static appearance and towards the scenes in which actions occur. In this work, we seek to find the source of this bias and question whether the observed biases towards static appearances are inherent to 3D convolutional networks or represent limited significance of motion in the training data. We resolve this by presenting temporality measures that estimate the data-to-model motion dependency at both the layer-level and the kernel-level. Moreover, we introduce two synthetic datasets where motion and appearance are decoupled by design, which allows us to directly observe their effects on the networks. Our analysis shows that 3D architectures are not inherently biased towards appearance. When trained on the most prevalent video sets, 3D convolutional networks are indeed biased throughout, especially in the final layers of the network. However, when training on data with motions and appearances explicitly decoupled and balanced, such networks adapt to varying levels of temporality. To this end, we see the proposed measures as a reliable method to estimate motion relevance for activity classification in datasets and use them to uncover the differences between popular pre-training video collections, such as Kinetics, IG-65M and Howto100 m.","tags":["Action and behavior recognition"],"title":"Are 3D convolutional networks inherently biased towards appearance?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William Thong","Cees G M Snoek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1667260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667260800,"objectID":"cf6bf9ae78f639abc43fb3df97c3ec6b","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/william-tomm-2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/william-tomm-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper strives for a diversely-supervised visual product search, where queries specify a diverse set of labels to search for.

In particular, we consider three continual learning scenarios, namely, task and class incremental learning and the newly defined cross-domain incremental learning.

We perform a thorough analysis of the performance and examine how the well-known challenges of continual learning, such as the catastrophic forgetting exhibit themselves in this setting. The encouraging results demonstrate that continual learning has a major potential to advance disease classification and to produce a more robust and efficient learning framework for clinical settings.

We extracted time-varying responses from electrocorticographic recordings from patients pre-sented with stimuli that varied in duration, interstimulus interval (ISI) and contrast. Aggregating data across patients from both sexes yielded 98 electrodes with robust visual responses, covering both earlier (V1–V3) and higher-order (V3a/b, LO, TO, IPS) reti-notopic maps. In all regions, the temporal dynamics of neural responses exhibit several nonlinear features. Peak response ampli-tude saturates with high contrast and longer stimulus durations, the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs, and response latency decreases with increasing contrast. These features are accurately captured by a computational model composed of a small set of canonical neuronal operations, that is, linear filtering, rectification, exponentia-tion, and a delayed divisive normalization. We find that an increased normalization term captures both contrast- and adaptation-related response reductions, suggesting potentially shared underlying mechanisms. We additionally demonstrate both changes and invariance in temporal response dynamics between earlier and higher-order visual areas. Together, our results reveal the presence of a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics in the human visual cortex and demonstrate that a simple model captures these dynamics at millisecond resolution.","tags":["Neural information processing"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of neural responses in human visual cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiayi Shen","Zehao Xiao","Xiantong Zhen","Cees G.

By default, deep networks are not equipped with this inductive bias and therefore many alternative solutions have been proposed through differential optimization. Current approaches tend to optimize classification and separation jointly: aligning inputs with class vectors and separating class vectors angularly. This paper proposes a simple alternative: encoding maximum separation as an inductive bias in the network by adding one fixed matrix multiplication before computing the softmax activations. The main observation behind our approach is that separation does not require optimization but can be solved in closed-form prior to training and plugged into a network. We outline a recursive approach to obtain the matrix consisting of maximally separable vectors for any number of classes, which can be added with negligible engineering effort and computational overhead. Despite its simple nature, this one matrix multiplication provides real impact. We show that our proposal directly boosts classification, long-tailed recognition, out-of-distribution detection, and open-set recognition, from CIFAR to ImageNet. We find empirically that maximum separation works best as a fixed bias; making the matrix learnable adds nothing to the performance.

Our method improves over the existing rotation-equivariant implicit function from 0.69 to 0.89 (IoU) on the ShapeNet reconstruction task. We also show that our equivariant implicit function can be extended to other types of similarity transformations and generalizes to unseen translations and scaling.","tags":["3D computer vision"],"title":"3D Equivariant Graph Implicit Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artem Moskalev","Ivan Sosnovik","Volker Fischer","Arnold Smeulders"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663977600,"objectID":"10834e639c6a0b9c8560cf83ec92f2f4","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/artem-eccv-2022/","publishdate":"2022-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/artem-eccv-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"The standard approach to contrastive learning is to maximize the agreement between different views of the data. The views are ordered in pairs, such that they are either positive, encoding different views of the same object, or negative, corresponding to views of different objects. The supervisory signal comes from maximizing the total similarity over positive pairs, while the negative pairs are needed to avoid collapse. In this work, we note that the approach of considering individual pairs cannot account for both intra-set and inter-set similarities when the sets are formed from the views of the data. It thus limits the information content of the supervisory signal available to train representations. We propose to go beyond contrasting individual pairs of objects by focusing on contrasting objects as sets. For this, we use combinatorial quadratic assignment theory designed to evaluate set and graph similarities and derive set-contrastive objective as a regularizer for contrastive learning methods.

Moreover, we consider various design choices to learn optimal student architectures including an end-to-end learnable architecture search. By extensive experiments on a wide range of architectures, including the most efficient ones, we demonstrate that delta distillation sets a new state of the art in terms of accuracy vs. efficiency tradeoff for semantic segmentation and object detection in videos.

In this paper, we investigate how sensitive video self-supervised learning is to the current conventional benchmark and whether methods generalize beyond the canonical evaluation setting.

Our study which encompasses over 500 experiments on 7 video datasets, 9 self-supervised methods and 6 video understanding tasks, reveals that current benchmarks in video self-supervised learning are not good indicators of generalization along these sensitivity factors. Further, we find that self-supervised methods considerably lag behind vanilla supervised pre-training, especially when domain shift is large and the amount of available downstream samples are low.

While proven effective, in many practical video settings even labelling a few examples appears unrealistic. This is especially true as the level of details in spatio-temporal video understanding and with it, the complexity of annotations continues to increase. Rather than performing few-shot learning with a human oracle to provide a few densely labelled support videos, we propose to automatically learn to find appropriate support videos given a query. We call this self-shot learning and we outline a simple self-supervised learning method to generate an embedding space well-suited for unsupervised retrieval of relevant samples. To showcase this novel setting, we tackle, for the first time, video instance segmentation in a self-shot (and few-shot) setting, where the goal is to segment instances at the pixel-level across the spatial and temporal domains. We provide strong baseline performances that utilize a novel transformer-based model and show that self-shot learning can even surpass few-shot and can be positively combined for further performance gains. Experiments on new benchmarks show that our approach achieves strong performance, is competitive to oracle support in some settings, scales to large unlabelled video collections, and can be combined in a semi-supervised setting.","tags":["Video analysis and understanding"],"title":"Less than Few: Self-Shot Video Instance Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laura Hanu","Yuki M.

However, the data is commonly assumed to originate from a single never-changing system. In contrast, when modeling real-world dynamical processes, the data distribution often shifts due to changes in the underlying system dynamics. Continual learning of these processes aims to rapidly adapt to abrupt system changes without forgetting previous dynamical regimes. This work proposes an approach to continual learning based on reservoir computing, a state-of-the-art method for training recurrent neural networks on complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems. Reservoir computing fixes the recurrent network weights - hence these cannot be forgotten - and only updates linear projection heads to the output. We propose to train multiple competitive prediction heads concurrently. Inspired by neuroscience’s predictive coding, only the most predictive heads activate, laterally inhibiting and thus protecting the inactive heads from forgetting induced by interfering parameter updates. We show that this multi-head reservoir minimizes interference and catastrophic forgetting on several dynamical systems, including the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and the high-dimensional Lorenz-96 weather model. Our results suggest that reservoir computing is a promising candidate framework for the continual learning of dynamical systems.

Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow, CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representations obtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results on scalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, in which only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. In experiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methods on recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrained autoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causal factors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causal representation learning.","tags":["Causal Representation Learning"],"title":"CITRIS - Causal Identifiability from Temporal Intervened Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David M.

Specifi- cally, in DPCN, a dynamic convolution module (DCM) is firstly proposed to generate dynamic kernels from support foreground, then information interaction is achieved by con- volution operations over query features using these kernels. Moreover, we equip DPCN with a support activation mod- ule (SAM) and a feature filtering module (FFM) to generate pseudo mask and filter out background information for the query images, respectively. SAM and FFM together can mine enriched context information from the query features. Our DPCN is also flexible and efficient under the k-shot FSS setting.

Moreover, the Reciprocal Neighbor Softmax achieves sparse attention to relevant -- rather than all -- neighbors only, which alleviates interference of irrelevant representations and further relieves the computational burden.

In this paper, we argue that self-supervised learning of object parts is a solution to this issue. Object parts are generalizable: they are a priori independent of an object definition, but can be grouped to form objects a posteriori. To this end, we leverage the recently proposed Vision Transformer's capability of attending to objects and combine it with a spatially dense clustering task for fine-tuning the spatial tokens. Our method surpasses the state-of-the-art on three semantic segmentation benchmarks by 17%-3%, showing that our representations are versatile under various object definitions.

We tackle this problem by first designing a self-supervised framework with a contrastive objective that jointly learns to classify and localise objects. Then, without using any supervision, we simply use these self-supervised labels and boxes to train an image-based object detector.

TubeR learns a set of tubelet-queries and utilizes a tubelet-attention module to model the dynamic spatio-temporal nature of a video clip, which effectively reinforces the model capacity compared to using actor-positional hypotheses in the spatio-temporal space. For videos containing transitional states or scene changes, we propose a context aware classification head to utilize short-term and long-term context to strengthen action classification, and an action switch regression head for detecting the precise temporal action extent. TubeR directly produces action tubelets with variable lengths and even maintains good results for long video clips.

A promising direction is continuous optimization for score-based methods, which efficiently learns the causal graph in a data-driven manner.

In this paper, we present ENCO, an efficient structure learning method for directed, acyclic causal graph leveraging observational and interventional data. ENCO formulates the graph search as an optimization of independent edge likelihoods, with the edge orientation being modeled as a separate parameter. Consequently, we can provide convergence guarantees of ENCO under mild conditions without constraining the score function with respect to acyclicity. In experiments, we show that ENCO can efficiently recover graphs with hundreds of nodes, an order of magnitude larger than what was previously possible.","tags":["Causal Discovery"],"title":"Efficient Neural Causal Discovery without Acyclicity Constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yingjun Du","Xiantong Zhen","Ling Shao","Cees G.

We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features.

We leverage a meta-learning paradigm to learn our model to acquire the ability of adaptation with single samples at training time so as to further adapt itself to each single test sample at test time. We formulate the adaptation to the single test sample as a variational Bayesian inference problem, which incorporates the test sample as a conditional into the generation of model parameters. The adaptation to each test sample requires only one feed-forward computation at test time without any fine-tuning or self-supervised training on additional data from the unseen domains.

While a common way to evaluate self-supervised representations is through transfer to various downstream tasks, we instead investigate the problem of measuring their interpretability, i.e. understanding the semantics encoded in raw representations. We formulate the latter as estimating the mutual information between the representation and a space of manually labelled concepts. To quantify this we introduce a decoding bottleneck: information must be captured by simple predictors, mapping concepts to clusters in representation space. This approach, which we call reverse linear probing, provides a single number sensitive to the semanticity of the representation. This measure is also able to detect when the representation contains combinations of concepts (e.g., \"red apple') instead of just individual attributes (\"red' and \"apple' independently). Finally, we propose to use supervised classifiers to automatically label large datasets in order to enrich the space of concepts used for probing. We use our method to evaluate a large number of self-supervised representations, ranking them by interpretability, highlight the differences that emerge compared to the standard evaluation with linear probes and discuss several qualitative insights.

Second, training requires an oracle stopping criterion as during the optimization the performance degrades after reaching an optimum value.

We compare conventional face anonymizers with three state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network-based (GAN) methods, by training an off-the-shelf face detector on anonymized data. Our experiments investigate the suitability of anonymization methods for maintaining face detector performance, the effect of detectors overtraining on anonymization artefacts, dataset size for training an anonymizer, and the effect of training time of anonymization GANs. A final experiment investigates the correlation between common GAN evaluation metrics and the performance of a trained face detector. Although all tested anonymization methods lower the performance of trained face detectors, faces anonymized using GANs cause far smaller performance degradation than conventional methods. As the most important finding, the best-performing GAN, DeepPrivacy, removes identifiable faces for a face detector trained on anonymized data, resulting in a modest decrease from 91.0 to 88.3 mAP.  In the last few years, there have been rapid improvements in realism of GAN-generated faces.

WeakSTIL compresses tiles of a WSI using a feature extractor pre-trained with self-supervised learning on unlabeled histopathology data and learns to predict precise sTIL% scores for each tile in the tumor bed by using a multiple instance learning regressor that only requires a weak WSI-level label. By requiring only a weak label, we overcome the large annotation efforts required to train currently existing TIL detection methods. We show that Weak-STIL is at least as good as other TIL detection methods when predicting the WSI-level sTIL% score, reaching a coefficient of determination of 0.45 ±0.15 when compared to scores generated by an expert pathologist, and an AUC of 0.89 ±0.05 when treating it as the clinically interesting sTIL-high vs sTIL-low classification task.

However, these datasets have ethical and technical shortcomings, such as containing personal information taken without consent, unclear license usage, biases, and, in some cases, even problematic image content. On the other hand, state-of-the-art pretraining is nowadays obtained with unsupervised methods, meaning that labelled datasets such as ImageNet may not be necessary, or perhaps not even optimal, for model pretraining. We thus propose an unlabelled dataset PASS: Pictures without humAns for Self-Supervision. PASS only contains images with CC-BY license and complete attribution metadata, addressing the copyright issue. Most importantly, it contains no images of people at all, and also avoids other types of images that are problematic for data protection or ethics. We show that PASS can be used for pretraining with methods such as MoCo-v2, SwAV and DINO.

A large class of such systems can be formalized as geometric graphs, i.e., graphs with nodes positioned in the Euclidean space given an arbitrarily chosen global coordinate system, for instance vehicles in a traffic scene. Notwithstanding the arbitrary global coordinate system, the governing dynamics of the respective dynamical systems are invariant to rotations and translations, also known as Galilean invariance. As ignoring these invariances leads to worse generalization, in this work we propose local coordinate frames per node-object to induce roto-translation invariance to the geometric graph of the interacting dynamical system. Further, the local coordinate frames allow for a natural definition of anisotropic filtering in graph neural networks.

To tackle this challenge, we propose variational multi-task learning (VMTL), a general probabilistic inference framework for learning multiple related tasks. We cast multi-task learning as a variational Bayesian inference problem, in which task relatedness is explored in a unified manner by specifying priors. To incorporate shared knowledge into each task, we design the prior of a task to be a learnable mixture of the variational posteriors of other related tasks, which is learned by the Gumbel-Softmax technique. In contrast to previous methods, our VMTL can exploit task relatedness for both representations and classifiers in a principled way by jointly inferring their posteriors. This enables individual tasks to fully leverage inductive biases provided by related tasks, therefore improving the overall performance of all tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VMTL is able to effectively tackle a variety of challenging multi-task learning settings with limited training data for both classification and regression.

Current SE-CNNs rely on weight sharing and filter rescaling, the latter of which is accurate for integer scales only. To reach accurate scale equivariance, we derive general constraints under which scale-convolution remains equivariant to discrete rescaling.

Where objects provide a local view on the content in videos, in this work we also seek to include a global view of the scene in which actions occur. We find that scenes on their own are also capable of recognizing unseen actions, albeit more marginally than objects, and a direct combination of object-based and scene-based scores degrades the action recognition performance. To get the best out of objects and scenes, we propose to construct them as a Cartesian product of all possible compositions. We outline how to determine the likelihood of object-scene compositions in videos, as well as a semantic matching from object-scene compositions to actions that enforces diversity among the most relevant compositions for each action.

Historically, these principles were considered anatomically separate, with retinotopy restricted to the occipital cortex and category-selectivity emerging in the lateral-occipital and ventral-temporal cortex. However, recent studies show that category-selective regions exhibit systematic retinotopic biases, for example exhibiting stronger activation for stimuli presented in the contra- compared to the ipsilateral visual field. It is unclear, however, whether responses within category-selective regions are more strongly driven by retinotopic location or by category preference, and if there are systematic differences between category-selective regions in the relative strengths of these preferences. Here, we directly compare contralateral and category preferences by measur- ing fMRI responses to scene and face stimuli presented in the left or right visual field and computing two bias indices: a contralateral bias (response to the contralateral minus ipsilateral visual field) and a face/scene bias (preferred response to scenes compared to faces, or vice versa). We compare these biases within and between scene- and face-selective regions and across the lateral and ventral surfaces of the visual cortex more broadly. We find an interaction between surface and bias: lateral surface regions show a stronger contralateral than face/scene bias, whilst ventral surface regions show the opposite. These effects are robust across and within subjects, and appear to reflect large-scale, smoothly varying gradients. Together, these findings support distinct functional roles for the lateral and ventral visual cortex in terms of the relative importance of the spatial location of stimuli during visual information processing.","tags":["Human Visual Perception"],"title":"Direct comparison of category and spatial selectivity in human occipitotemporal cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheyun Qin","Xiankai Lu","Xiushan Nie","Xiantong Zhen","Yilong Yin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1634774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634774400,"objectID":"44be9954a1ca7c3d906b835ae802130c","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/zhequn-acmmm-2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/zhequn-acmmm-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we address video instance segmentation using a new generative model that learns effective representations of the target and background appearance.

In this paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal aspect of videos. First, for space, we show that spatial augmentations such as cropping do work well for videos too, but that previous implementations, due to the high processing and memory cost, could not do this at a scale sufficient for it to work well. To address this issue, we first introduce Feature Crop, a method to simulate such augmentations much more efficiently directly in feature space.

In these images, there is typically a relatively small number of objects per class, which usually is manageable to annotate. However, outside the setting of regular images, we are often confronted with a different situation. In computational pathology, digitised tissue sections are extremely large images, whose dimensions quickly exceed 250'000x250'000 pixels, where relevant objects, such as tumour cells or lymphocytes can quickly number in the millions. Annotating them all is practically impossible and annotating sparsely a few, out of many more, is the only possibility. Unfortunately, learning from sparse annotations, or sparse-shot learning, clashes with standard supervised learning because what is not annotated is treated as a negative. However, assigning negative labels to what are true positives leads to confusion in the gradients and biased learning. To this end, we present exclusive cross-entropy, which slows down the biased learning by examining the second-order loss derivatives in order to drop the loss terms corresponding to likely biased terms. Experiments on nine datasets and two different localisation tasks, detection with YOLLO and segmentation with Unet, show that we obtain considerable improvements compared to cross-entropy or focal loss, while often reaching the best possible performance for the model with only 10-40% of annotations.

Here we build on a standard macroeconomic model in which a single rational representative household makes a savings decision of how much to consume or invest. In our model, households are myopic boundedly rational heterogeneous agents embedded in a social network. From time to time each household updates its savings rate by copying the savings rate of its neighbor with the highest consumption. If the updating time is short, the economy is stuck in a poverty trap, but for longer updating times economic output approaches its optimal value, and we observe a critical transition to an economy with irregular endogenous oscillations in economic output, resembling a business cycle. In this regime households divide into two groups: poor households with low savings rates and rich households with high savings rates. Thus, inequality and economic dynamics both occur spontaneously as a consequence of imperfect household decision-making. Adding a few “rational” agents with a fixed savings rate equal to the long-term optimum allows us to match business cycle timescales. Our work here supports an alternative program of research that substitutes utility maximization for behaviorally grounded decision-making.","tags":["Complexity Economics"],"title":"Emergent inequality and business cycles in a simple behavioral macroeconomic model ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zehao Xiao","Jiayi Shen","Xiantong Zhen","Ling Shao","Cees G.

The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the 'distillation' of features at various layers of an expert network, pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given the input data. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploiting the expert's knowledge and more distinctive discrepancy compared to solely utilizing the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework for the localization of anomalous regions. Despite the striking contrast between some test datasets and ImageNet, we achieve competitive or significantly superior results compared to the SOTA methods on MNIST, F-MNIST, CIFAR-10, MVTecAD, Retinal-OCT, and two Medical datasets on both anomaly detection and localization.","tags":["Transfer, low-shot, semi- and un- supervised learning"],"title":"Multiresolution Knowledge Distillation for Anomaly Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Wray","Hazel Doughty","Dima Damen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619049600,"objectID":"e34efe3a6230038dda80bfa5f7c71088","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/hazeldoughty-cvpr-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/hazeldoughty-cvpr-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Current video retrieval efforts all found their evaluation on an instance-based assumption, that only a single caption is relevant to a query video and vice versa.

To circumvent the adverse effect of rotations, we present rotation-equivariant Siamese networks (RE-SiamNets), built through the use of group-equivariant convolutional layers comprising steerable filters. SiamNets allow estimating the change in orientation of the object in an unsupervised manner, thereby facilitating its use in relative 2D pose estimation as well. We further show that this change in orientation can be used to impose an additional motion constraint in Siamese tracking through imposing restriction on the change in orientation between two consecutive frames. For benchmarking, we present Rotation Tracking Benchmark (RTB), a dataset comprising a set of videos with rotation instances. Through experiments on two popular Siamese architectures, we show that RE-SiamNets handle the problem of rotation very well and out-perform their regular counterparts. Further, RE-SiamNets can accurately estimate the relative change in pose of the target in an unsupervised fashion, namely the in-plane rotation the target has sustained with respect to the reference frame.","tags":["motion and tracking"],"title":"Rotation Equivariant Siamese Networks for Tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phillip Lippe","Efstratios Gavves"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"7fdaf3440bdd657f0deffa1adfc77f65","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/phillip-iclr-2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/phillip-iclr-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite their popularity, to date, the application of normalizing flows on categorical data stays limited. The current practice of using dequantization to map discrete data to a continuous space is inapplicable as categorical data has no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we investigate Categorical Normalizing Flows, that is normalizing flows for categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous representation and the model likelihood. Using a factorized decoder, we introduce an inductive bias to model any interactions in the normalizing flow. As a consequence, we do not only simplify the optimization compared to having a joint decoder, but also make it possible to scale up to a large number of categories that is currently impossible with discrete normalizing flows. Based on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs. GraphCNF implements a three step approach modeling the nodes, edges, and adjacency matrix stepwise to increase efficiency.

By adopting the philosophy of the classical Lifting Scheme from signal processing, we propose LiftPool for bidirectional pooling layers, including LiftDownPool and LiftUpPool. LiftDownPool decomposes a feature map into various downsized sub-bands, each of which contains information with different frequencies. As the pooling function in LiftDownPool is perfectly invertible, by performing LiftDownPool backwards, a corresponding up-pooling layer LiftUpPool is able to generate a refined upsampled feature map using the detail sub-bands, which is useful for image-to-image translation challenges.

In this paper, we propose a novel method that alleviates this by leveraging a generative model to naturally push these related samples together: each sample's caption must be reconstructed as a weighted combination of other support samples' visual representations. This simple idea ensures that representations are not overly-specialized to individual samples, are reusable across the dataset, and results in representations that explicitly encode semantics shared between samples, unlike noise contrastive learning.

Mathematically, one of the key ingredients of success of the similarity function is translation equivariance. Non-translation-equivariant architectures induce a positional bias during training, so the location of the target will be hard to recover from the feature space. In real life scenarios, objects undergoe various transformations other than translation, such as rotation or scaling. Unless the model has an internal mechanism to handle them, the similarity may degrade. In this paper, we focus on scaling and we aim to equip the Siamese network with additional built-in scale equivariance to capture the natural variations of the target a priori. We develop the theory for scale-equivariant Siamese trackers, and provide a simple recipe for how to make a wide range of existing trackers scale-equivariant.

For the RGB, and derived optical-flow, modality many large-scale labeled datasets have been made available. They have become the de facto pre-training choice when recognizing or detecting new actions from RGB datasets that have limited amounts of labeled examples available. Unfortunately, large-scale labeled action datasets for other modalities are unavailable for pre-training. In this paper, our goal is to recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by learning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step training process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an RGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we then fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target modality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision strategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the target modality) to transfer feature-level representations from the teacher to the student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets and two non-RGB target datasets demonstrate that an optical-flow teacher provides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and 3D-skeletons, even when evaluated on a different target domain, or for a different task. Compared to alternative cross-modal action transfer methods we show a good improvement in performance especially when labeled non-RGB examples to learn from are scarce.","tags":["action recognition"],"title":"Feature-Supervised Action Modality Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Efstratios Gavves","Ran Tao","Deepak Gupta","Arnold Smeulders"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609200000,"objectID":"ff954a05bd01c2df28fdff76dadc3063","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/gavves-icpr-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/gavves-icpr-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Updating the tracker model with adverse bounding box predictions adds an unavoidable bias term to the learning. This bias term, which we refer to as model decay, offsets the learning and causes tracking drift.

In this paper, we look at the problem of model bias from a mathematical perspective. Further, we briefly examine the effect of various sources of tracking error on model decay, using a correlation filter (ECO) and a Siamese (SINT) tracker.

However, as softmax is specifically designed for categorical classification, it assumes each image has just one class label. This limits its applicability for problems where the number of labels does not equal one, most notably zero-and multi-label problems. In these challenging settings, binary classifiers are, in theory, better suited. However, as they ignore the correlation between classes, they are not as accurate and scalable in practice. In this paper, we start from the observation that the only difference between binary and softmax classifiers is their normalization function. Specifically, while the binary classifier self-normalizes its score, the softmax classifier combines the scores from all classes before normalisation. On the basis of this observation we introduce a normalization function that is learnable, constant, and shared between classes and data points. By doing so, we arrive at a new type of binary classifier that we coin quasibinary classifier. We show in a variety of image classification settings, and on several datasets, that quasibinary classifiers are considerably better in classification settings where regular binary and softmax classifiers suffer, including zerolabel and multi-label classification. What is more, we show that quasibinary classifiers yield well-calibrated probabilities allowing for direct and reliable comparisons, not only between classes but also between data points.","tags":["recognition"],"title":"Quasibinary Classifier for Images with Zero and Multiple Labels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mert Kilickaya","Noureldien Hussein","Efstratios Gavves","Arnold Smeulders"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609200000,"objectID":"6d7aec9c1e3b951a907680b23e905e74","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/publication/mert-icpr-2020-/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/publication/mert-icpr-2020-/","section":"publication","summary":"Human-object interaction recognition aims for identifying the relationship between a human subject and an object. Researchers incorporate global scene context into the early layers of deep Convolutional Neural Networks as a solution. They report a significant increase in the performance since generally interactions are correlated with the scene (\\ie riding bicycle on the city street). However, this approach leads to the following problems. It increases the network size in the early layers, therefore not efficient. It leads to noisy filter responses when the scene is irrelevant, therefore not accurate. It only leverages scene context whereas human-object interactions offer a multitude of contexts, therefore incomplete. To circumvent these issues, in this work, we propose Self-Selective Context (SSC). SSC operates on the joint appearance of human-objects and context to bring the most discriminative context(s) into play for recognition. We devise novel contextual features that model the locality of human-object interactions and show that SSC can seamlessly integrate with the State-of-the-art interaction recognition models.

To that end, we seek for a self-supervised approach, where a network learns a latent metric to distinguish between points translated by flow estimations and the target point cloud. Our adversarial metric learning includes a multi-scale triplet loss on sequences of two-point clouds as well as a cycle consistency loss. Furthermore, we outline a benchmark for self-supervised scene flow estimation: the Scene Flow Sandbox. The benchmark consists of five datasets designed to study individual aspects of flow estimation in progressive order of complexity, from a moving object to real-world scenes. Experimental evaluation on the benchmark shows that our approach obtains state-of-the-art self-supervised scene flow results, outperforming recent neighbor-based approaches. We use our proposed benchmark to expose shortcomings and draw insights on various training setups. We find that our setup captures motion coherence and preserves local geometries.

Multiple computational models have been proposed to account for these dynamics in several measurement domains, including single-cell recordings, psychophysics, and fMRI. It is challenging to compare these models because there are differences in model form, test stimuli, and instrument. Here we present a new dataset that is well-suited to compare models of neural temporal dynamics. The dataset is from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of human visual cortex, which measures cortical neural population responses with high spatial and temporal precision. The stimuli were large, static contrast patterns and varied systematically in contrast, duration, and inter-stimulus interval (ISI). Time-varying broadband responses were computed using the power envelope of the band-pass filtered voltage time course (50-170 Hz) recorded from a total of 126 electrodes in ten epilepsy patients, covering earlier (V1-V4) and higher-order (LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all visual regions, the ECoG broadband responses show several non-linear features: peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and long stimulus durations; response latency decreases with increasing contrast; and the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs. These features were well predicted by a computational model (Zhou, Benson, Kay and Winawer, 2019) comprised of a small set of canonical neuronal operations: linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and a delayed divisive gain control. These results demonstrate that a simple computational model comprised of canonical neuronal computations captures a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics at millisecond resolution.

In this study, participants performed an animal detection task on low, medium or high complexity scenes as determined by two biologically plausible natural scene statistics, contrast energy (CE) or spatial coherence (SC). In experiment 1, stimuli were sampled such that CE and SC both influenced scene complexity. Diffusion modelling showed that the speed of information processing was affected by low-level scene complexity. Experiment 2a/b refined these observations by showing how isolated manipulation of SC resulted in weaker but comparable effects, with an additional change in response boundary, whereas manipulation of only CE had no effect. Overall, performance was best for scenes with intermediate complexity.

To deal with domain shift, we learn domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy.

Starting from an autoregressive model, we generate image color distributions, from which diverse colored results are sampled. We propose two ways to incorporate object semantics into the colorization model: through a pixelated semantic embedding and a pixelated semantic generator.

Here, we propose an activity network that fuses multimodal inputs coming from completely different and het- erogeneous sensors. We frame such a heterogeneous fusion as a non-local operation. The observation is that in a non-local operation, only the channel dimensions need to match. In the network, heterogeneous inputs are fused, while maintaining the shapes and dimensionalities that fit each input. We outline both asymmetric fusion, where one modality serves to enforce the other, and symmetric fusion variants. To further promote research into multimodal activity recognition, we introduce GloVid, a first-person activity dataset captured with video recordings and smart glove sensor readings.

In this paper, we make the step towards an open setting where multiple visual domains are available. This notably translates into a search between any pair of domains, from a combination of domains or within multiple domains. We introduce a simple -- yet effective -- approach. We formulate the search as a mapping from every visual domain to a common semantic space, where categories are represented by hyperspherical prototypes. Open cross-domain visual search is then performed by searching in the common semantic space, regardless of which domains are used as source or target. Domains are combined in the common space to search from or within multiple domains simultaneously. A separate training of every domain-specific mapping function enables an efficient scaling to any number of domains without affecting the search performance. We empirically illustrate our capability to perform open cross-domain visual search in three different scenarios.

We identify two problems with using the full dataset: (i) there is an imbalance between the number of examples per concept, and (ii) not all concepts are equally relevant for events. In this article, we propose to balance large-scale image hierarchies for pre-training. We shuffle concepts based on bottom-up and top-down operations to overcome the problems of example imbalance and concept relevance. Using this strategy, we arrive at the shuffled ImageNet bank, a concept bank with an order of magnitude more concepts compared to standard ImageNet banks. Compared to standard ImageNet pre-training, our shuffles result in more discriminative representations to train event models from the limited video event examples. For event search, the broad range of concepts enable a closer match between textual queries of events and concept detections in videos.

Nevertheless, measuring physical properties from visual observations is challenging due to the high number of causally underlying physical parameters – including material properties and external forces. In this paper, we propose to measure latent physical properties for cloth in the wind without ever having seen a real example before. Our solution is an iterative refinement procedure with simulation at its core. The algorithm gradually updates the physical model parameters by running a simulation of the observed phenomenon and comparing the current simulation to a real-world observation. The correspondence is measured using an embedding function that maps physically similar examples to nearby points. We consider a case study of cloth in the wind, with curling flags as our leading example – a seemingly simple phenomena but physically highly involved. Based on the physics of cloth and its visual manifestation, we propose an instantiation of the embedding function. For this mapping, modeled as a deep network, we introduce a spectral layer that decomposes a video volume into its temporal spectral power and corresponding frequencies. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably to prior work on the task of measuring cloth material properties and external wind force from a real-world video.","tags":[],"title":"Cloth in the Wind: A Case Study of Physical Measurement through Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

However, there are several reasons that backpropagation could not be plausibly implemented by biological neurons. Among these are the facts that (1) biological neurons appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients backwards across synapses, and (2) biological “spiking” neurons emit binary signals, whereas back-propagation requires that neurons communicate continuous values between one another. Recently, Scellier and Bengio [2017], demonstrated an alternative to backpropagation, called Equilibrium Propagation, wherein gradients are implicitly computed by the dynamics of the neural network, so that neurons do not need an internal mechanism for backpropagation of gradients. This provides an interesting solution to problem (1). In this paper, we address problem (2) by proposing a way in which Equilibrium Propagation can be implemented with neurons which are constrained to just communicate binary values at each time step. We show that with appropriate step-size annealing, we can converge to the same fixed-point as a real-valued neural network, and that with predictive coding, we can make this convergence much faster.

A wide variety of pruning-based acceleration methods were proposed to expend the sparsity of parameters, thus omit computations involving those pruned parameters. However, these element-wise pruning methods can hardly be efficiently used for accelerating without special-customized speed-up algorithms. Due to this difficulty, recent work has turned to prune filters or channels instead, which directly reduce the number of matrix multiplications. While Channel Pruning method reforms the original CNNs to a kernel-wisely or channel-wisely pruned one, Runtime Neural Pruning (RNP) argues that models pruned with static pruning methods will lose the ability for some hard tasks since some potentially significant weights are lost during the pruning process. Dynamically pruning the channels is found to be a good solution. In this paper, we propose to use Channel Threshold-Weighting (T-Weighting) modules to choose and prune unimportant feature channels at inference phase. As the pruning is done dynamically, it is called Dynamic Channel Pruning (DCP). DCP consists of the original convolutional network and a number of \"Channel T-Weighting\" modules at certain layers. The \"Channel T-Weighting\" module assigns weights to corresponding channels, pruning those channels whose weights are zero. Those pruned channels make the CNN accelerated, and those remained channels multiplying with weights help feature expression enhanced. The reason for not considering fully-connected layers are two-fold: 1. convolution operations occupying the vast majority of all computation cost. 2. DCP is not designed only for classification, but for many tasks taking CNN as their backbone networks. In this work, we propose as a specific choice for h(·) the thresholded sigmoid function to offer sparsity to w_l, called thresholded sigmoid (T-sigmoid), h(x) = σ(x)· 1{x  T}, where σ(·) refers to sigmoid function. 1{x} is boolean indicator function, where output being 1 when input x is True, and vice versa. The T-sigmoid function is inspired by spike-and-slab models, which formulates distributions over hidden variables as the product of a binary spike variable and a real-valued code. The DCP is trained in a layer-by-layer manner. We first train the \"Channel T-Weighting\" module, and then set the threshold based on the given pruned ratio, and adjust the threshold in an iterative way at the end. The proposed DCP could reach 5× speed-up with only 4.77% drops on ILSVRC2012 dataset. Comparing the increasing error with baseline methods (Filter Pruning, Channel Pruning and RNP), DCP outperforms other methods consistently as the speed-up ratio increasing. The experiment show that DCP also consistently outperforms the baseline model whenever for Cifar10 and Cifar100. By comparing the full model and accelerated model (3×), we can see that DCP generalized well on scenes classification task (on the Places365-Challenge dataset) with VGG-16, with the top-1 accuracy top-5 accuracy dropping 2.07% and 1.96% respectively. DCP (3×) trained with ResNet-50 also suffered slight drops, with the top-1 accuracy top-5 accuracy dropping 2.78% and 2.55% respectively, outperforming Channel Pruning (our impl.) by a large margin. For the detection task on the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset using Faster R-CNN, we observe 0.5% mAP drops and 1.7% mAP drops of our 2× acceleration model and 4× acceleration model respectively, showing little accuracy degradation, showing a competitive result for proving DCP generalized well on detection task.

A key differentiator of A-MCG is the integration of multi-scale context features between support and query branches, enforcing a better guidance from the support set. In addition, we also adopt a spatial attention along the fusion branch to highlight context information from several scales, enhancing self-supervision in one-shot learning. To address the fusion problem in multi-shot learning, Conv-LSTM is adopted to collaboratively integrate the sequential support features to elevate the final accuracy.

By simulating each dimension of a data points k nearest neighbors space (kNNs) as a lever, we apply the lever principle to compute the balance fulcrum of each dimension after proving its inevitability and uniqueness. Then, we model the distance between the projected coordinate of the data point and the balance fulcrum on each dimension and construct the DHBlan coefficient to measure the balance of the neighborhood space. Based on this theoretical model, we propose a simple yet effective cluster boundary detection algorithm called Lever. Experiments on both low- and high-dimensional data sets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

We propose to treat these ideograms as a new modality in their own right, distinct in their semantic structure from both the text in which they are often embedded as well as the images which they resemble. As a new modality, emoji present rich novel possibilities for representation and interaction. In this paper, we explore the challenges that arise naturally from considering the emoji modality through the lens of multimedia research. Specifically, the ways in which emoji can be related to other common modalities such as text and images. To do so, we first present a large scale dataset of real-world emoji usage collected from Twitter. This dataset contains examples of both text-emoji and image-emoji relationships. We present baseline results on the challenge of predicting emoji from both text and images, using state-of-the-art neural networks. Further, we offer a first consideration into the problem of how to account for new, unseen emoji - a relevant issue as the emoji vocabulary continues to expand on a yearly basis. Finally, we present results for multimedia retrieval using emoji as queries.","tags":[],"title":"New Modality: Emoji Challenges in Prediction, Anticipation, and Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

In the literature, the consensus is to achieve localization by training on bounding box annotations provided for each frame of each training video. As annotating boxes in video is expensive, cumbersome and error-prone, we propose to bypass box-supervision. Instead, we introduce action localization based on point-supervision. We start from unsupervised spatio-temporal proposals, which provide a set of candidate regions in videos. While normally used exclusively for inference, we show spatio-temporal proposals can also be leveraged during training when guided by a sparse set of point annotations. We introduce an overlap measure between points and spatio-temporal proposals and incorporate them all into a new objective of a multiple instance learning optimization. During inference, we introduce pseudo-points, visual cues from videos, that automatically guide the selection of spatio-temporal proposals. We outline five spatial and one temporal pseudo-point, as well as a measure to best leverage pseudo-points at test time. Experimental evaluation on three action localization datasets shows our pointly-supervised approach (1) is as effective as traditional box-supervision at a fraction of the annotation cost, (2) is robust to sparse and noisy point annotations, (3) benefits from pseudo-points during inference, and (4) outperforms recent weakly-supervised alternatives. This leads us to conclude that points provide a viable alternative to boxes for action localization.","tags":["action localization","weakly-supervised learning"],"title":"Pointly-Supervised Action Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

It appears in human activity (sports, cooking), animal behavior (a bee’s waggle dance), natural phenomena (leaves in the wind) and in urban environments (flashing lights). Estimating visual repetition from realistic video is challenging as periodic motion is rarely perfectly static and stationary. To better deal with realistic video, we elevate the static and stationary assumptions often made by existing work. Our spatiotemporal filtering approach, established on the theory of periodic motion, effectively handles a wide variety of appearances and requires no learning. Starting from motion in 3D we derive three periodic motion types by decomposition of the motion field into its fundamental components. In addition, three temporal motion continuities emerge from the field’s temporal dynamics. For the 2D perception of 3D motion we consider the viewpoint relative to the motion; what follows are 18 cases of recurrent motion perception. To estimate repetition under all circumstances, our theory implies constructing a mixture of differential motion maps: F, ∇F, ∇·F and ∇×F. We temporally convolve the motion maps with wavelet filters to estimate repetitive dynamics. Our method is able to spatially segment repetitive motion directly from the temporal filter responses densely computed over the motion maps. For experimental verification of our claims, we use our novel dataset for repetition estimation, better-reflecting reality with non-static and non-stationary repetitive motion. On the task of repetition counting, we obtain favorable results compared to a deep learning alternative.","tags":["repetition estimation"],"title":"Repetition Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

This task differs from standard few-shot settings, since we aim to address the localization problem, rather than the global classification problem. To tackle this new problem, we propose a network that aims to get the most out of the support and query images. To that end, we introduce a spatial similarity module that searches the spatial commonality among the given images. We furthermore introduce a feature reweighting module to balance the influence of different support images through graph convolutional networks. To evaluate fewshot common-localization, we repurpose and reorganize the well-known Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets, as well as a video dataset from ImageNet VID.

The reason is classification’s natural containment within a probability n-simplex, as defined by the popular softmax activation function. Regular regression lacks such a closed geometry, leading to unstable training and convergence to suboptimal local minima. Starting from this insight we revisit regression in convolutional neural networks. We observe many continuous output problems in computer vision are naturally contained in closed geometrical manifolds, like the Euler angles in viewpoint estimation or the normals in surface normal estimation. A natural framework for posing such continuous output problems are n-spheres, which are naturally closed geometric manifolds defined in the R (n+1) space. By introducing a spherical exponential mapping on n-spheres at the regression output, we obtain well-behaved gradients, leading to stable training. We show how our spherical regression can be utilized for several computer vision challenges, specifically viewpoint estimation, surface normal estimation and 3D rotation estimation. For all these problems our experiments demonstrate the benefit of spherical regression.","tags":[],"title":"Spherical Regression: Learning Viewpoints, Surface Normals and 3D Rotations on n-Spheres","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

In contrast, we use multi-scale temporal convolutions, and we reduce the complexity of 3D convolutions. The outcome is Timeception convolution layers, which reasons about minute-long temporal patterns, a factor of 8 longer than best related works.

A dynamic image encodes temporal data such as RGB or optical flow videos by using the concept of rank pooling. The idea is to learn a ranking machine that captures the temporal evolution of the data and to use the parameters of the latter as a representation. When a linear ranking machine is used, the resulting representation is in the form of an image, which we call dynamic because it summarizes the video dynamics in addition of appearance. This is a powerful idea because it allows to convert any video to an image so that existing CNN models pre-trained for the analysis of still images can be immediately extended to videos. We also present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator, accelerating standard rank pooling algorithms by orders of magnitude, and formulate that as a CNN layer.

Consequently, most researchers have designed methods tailored to this \"short-term\" scenario, which is poorly representative of practitioners  needs. Aiming to address this disparity, we compile a long-term, large-scale tracking dataset of sequences with average length greater than two minutes and with frequent target object disappearance. The OxUvA dataset is much larger than the object tracking datasets of recent years: it comprises 366 sequences spanning 14 hours of video. We assess the performance of several algorithms, considering both the ability to locate the target and to determine whether it is present or absent. Our goal is to offer the community a large and diverse benchmark to enable the design and evaluation of tracking methods ready to be used \"in the wild\".","tags":["tracking"],"title":"Long-Term Tracking in the Wild: A Benchmark","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Existing work shows good results under the assumption of static and stationary periodicity. As realistic video is rarely perfectly static and stationary, the often preferred Fourier-based measurements is inapt. Instead, we adopt the wavelet transform to better handle non-static and non-stationary video dynamics. From the flow field and its differentials, we derive three fundamental motion types and three motion continuities of intrinsic periodicity in 3D. On top of this, the 2D perception of 3D periodicity considers two extreme viewpoints. What follows are 18 fundamental cases of recurrent perception in 2D. In practice, to deal with the variety of repetitive appearance, our theory implies measuring time-varying flow Ft and its differentials ∇Ft , ∇ · Ft and ∇ × Ft over segmented foreground motion. For experiments, we introduce the new QUVA Repetition dataset, reflecting reality by including non-static and non-stationary videos. On the task of counting repetitions in video, we obtain favorable results compared to a deep learning alternative.","tags":["repetition estimation"],"title":"Real-World Repetition Estimation by Div, Grad and Curl","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Matching rendered views of 3D shapes to RGB images is challenging because, 1) 3D shapes are not always a perfect match for the image queries, 2) there is great domain difference between rendered and RGB images, and 3) estimating the object scale versus distance is inherently ambiguous in images from uncalibrated cameras. In this work we propose a deeply learned matching function that attacks these challenges and can be used for a search engine that finds the appropriate 3D shape and matches it to objects in 2D query images. We evaluate the proposed matching function and search engine with a series of controlled experiments on the 24 most populated vehicle categories in PASCAL3D+. We test the capability of the learned matching function in transferring to unseen 3D shapes and study overall search engine sensitivity w.r.t. available 3D shapes and object localization accuracy, showing promising results in retrieving 3D shapes given 2D image queries.","tags":[],"title":"Searching and Matching Texture-free 3D Shapes in Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Video frames or audio samples which are sampled at nearby points in time tend to have similar values. Typically, deep learning algorithms take no advantage of this redundancy to reduce computation. This can be an obscene waste of energy. We present a variant on backpropagation for neural networks in which computation scales with the rate of change of the data - not the rate at which we process the data. We do this by having neurons communicate a combination of their state, and their temporal change in state. Intriguingly, this simple communication rule give rise to units that resemble biologically-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, and to a weight-update rule that is equivalent to a form of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a synaptic learning rule observed in the brain. We demonstrate that on MNIST and a temporal variant of MNIST, our algorithm performs about as well as a Multilayer Perceptron trained with backpropagation, despite only communicating discrete values between layers.","tags":[],"title":"Temporally Efficient Deep Learning with Spikes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

While many attempted to model time in videos, an explicit study on quantifying video time is missing. To fill this lacuna, we aim to evaluate video time explicitly. We describe three properties of video time, namely a) temporal asymmetry, b) temporal continuity and c) temporal causality. Based on each we formulate a task able to quantify the associated property. This allows assessing the effectiveness of modern video encoders, like C3D and LSTM, in their ability to model time. Our analysis provides insights about existing encoders while also leading us to propose a new video time encoder, which is better suited for the video time recognition tasks than C3D and LSTM. We believe the proposed meta-analysis can provide a reasonable baseline to assess video time encoders on equal grounds on a set of temporal-aware tasks.","tags":["action recognition"],"title":"Video Time: Properties, Encoders and Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

Rather than adapting the video to the peculiarities of established recurrent or convolutional architectures, we adapt the architecture to fit the requirements of the video medium. Starting from the soft-Attention LSTM, VideoLSTM makes three novel contributions. First, video has a spatial layout. To exploit the spatial correlation we hardwire convolutions in the soft-Attention LSTM architecture. Second, motion not only informs us about the action content, but also guides better the attention towards the relevant spatio-temporal locations. We introduce motion-based attention. And finally, we demonstrate how the attention from VideoLSTM can be exploited for action localization by relying on the action class label and temporal attention smoothing. Experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and THUMOS13 reveal the benefit of the video-specific adaptations of VideoLSTM in isolation as well as when integrated in a combined architecture. It compares favorably against other LSTM architectures for action classification and especially action localization.","tags":["action recognition"],"title":"VideoLSTM Convolves, Attends and Flows for Action Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vislab/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"}]
